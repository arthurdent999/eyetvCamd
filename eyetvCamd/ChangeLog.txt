Version 1.5 :
- Added EMM support for Seca, Conax and Nagra
- Partial EMM suport for NDS (EMM-U).
- Fixed an issue to match both the emmPid and the curent CAID 
   as some feed have 3 or more CAID using the same emmPid.
- Added a cleint ID to the newcamd client, This will work with OSCam 
   to identify eyetvCamd . This is just a cosmetic fix.
